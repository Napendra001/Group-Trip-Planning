# Group-Trip-Planning :
When the number of agents are fixed : run "Fixing Agents.py". The code runs our proposed algorithm and compare our algorithm run time with existing brute-force and GNN approach.In the code the agents are fixed and number of categories are changing from 2 to 6.
When the number of categories are fixed : run "Fixing Clusters.py". The code run and compare runtime of our algorithm with Brute-force and GNN.
These above codes create multiple CSV files that are used to plot graphs.
Here are two more files named "Agents Fixed Plots.py" and "Clusters Fixed Plots.py". These files are used to plot the graphs using CSV files.
The datasets are availabe at : https://www.cs.utah.edu/~lifeifei/SpatialDataset.htm
